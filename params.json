I've been a researcher in the Laboratory of Digital Signal Processing of Federal Institute of Ceará for two years and I've worked in projects related with image processing with OpenCV library and chaotic criptography projects with cellular automata which led to some [publication](http://www.infobrasil.inf.br/userfiles/OK-Criptografia-122414.pdf). My greatest interests currently are in big data and artificial intelligence fields such as data mining, machine learning and intelligent systems in general. I'm currently an entrepreneur working on personal projects related within machine learning.
